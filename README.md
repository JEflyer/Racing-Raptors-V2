# Racing-Raptors-V2
This is where I will store all development for Racing Raptors V2 Smart Contract work.


The contracts are seperated between interfaces, libraries, structs & contracts.

The majority of the game logic is in the libraries, to save gas on deployment & transaction execution.

The Oracle implementation still needs work to make sure it is truly random, currently it is only psuedorandom generation.

Testing of minter contract is almost complete.

V1 Raptor holders will be airdropped a V2 Raptor. 
The benefit of having one of these raptors is that if your raptor is injured in a fight then it will only have a 6 hour cooldow instead of a 12 hour cooldown.

95% of the prize pool for each race will be given to the winner of the race & 5% will be sent to a community committee multi-sig wallet.
The community fund will be used to buy NFTs from smaller projects & give them away to our community.

Upon completion of minting one lucky holder will be chosen at random with VRF & an event will be emitted to show that the wallet has won a Porsche Taycan Turbo S or crypto equivalant.

I will only be deploying the contracts once everything is secure & tested.

If you see any problems with the code then come join my solidity dev discord study group & tell me! :D
